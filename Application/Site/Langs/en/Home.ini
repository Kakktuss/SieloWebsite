TABSPACE_PRESENTATION="No more tabs everywhere"
TABSPACE_FEATURE="This is the feature that makes Sielo so special. With tabs spaces you can divide your Sielo window into several spaces, as if you had several windows next to each other but still interacting with each others. You can resize your tabs spaces, hide them, mute them... This makes possible, among other things, to have several sessions, for example a session called "social networks", another called "music" and another called "work". Therefore you can hide the "music" tabs space and retrieve it at any time."
